<h1 id="bio">Bio</h1>
<p>I am a PhD candidate at Stanford University working with Professor <a
href="https://lihualei71.github.io/">Lihua Lei</a> in the Graduate
School of Business on sequential testing, multiple testing, and long-term effect inference. 
Our paper on FWER control for e-values is on <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09015">arXiv</a>!
I am also working with my advisor and the experiments team at DoorDash
to develop short-term proxies for long-term metrics based on historical
data, which I am presenting at CODE@MIT 2025 and hope to have 
a draft available soon.</p>
<p>Prior to attending Stanford, I earned my A.B. in Mathematics and
Statistics Cum Laude with High Honors, with a Secondary in Music, from
Harvard University. For my degree, I wrote a review of compressed
sensing for my <a href="/pdfs/hartog_thesis.pdf">thesis</a> with my
advisor Subhabrata Sen.</p>
<p>I have a strong passion for teaching, and I have been the primary
instructor for two Stanford statistics courses, twice each. I am part of
the curriculum redevelopment team for Stanford Statistics' Introduction
to Probability sequence, working on sections and leading a pilot tutorial
program. I was the coach for the first year statistics PhD students in their 
Summer 2024 applied statistics qualifying exam. Everyone passed! </p>
