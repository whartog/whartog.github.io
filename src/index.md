# Bio

I am a PhD candidate at Stanford University working with Professor [Lihua Lei](https://lihualei71.github.io/) in the Graduate School of Business on sequential testing and multiple testing. I also am interested in random graph models and am discussing properties of the geometric random graph model with Professor [Tselil Schramm](https://tselilschramm.org/) of Stanford Statistics. 

Prior to attending Stanford, I earned my A.B. in Mathematics and Statistics Cum Laude with High Honors, with a Secondary in Music, from Harvard University. For my degree, I wrote a review of compressed sensing for my [thesis](/pdfs/hartog_thesis.pdf) with my advisor Subhabrata Sen.

I have a strong passion for teaching, and I have been the primary instructor for two Stanford statistics courses. I will be reprising my role as instructor of Stats 100: Mathematics of Sport this winter quarter, and I am excited to continue to make sports statistics more accessible to the Stanford student body.

# Talks and Posters

* **CODE@MIT, October 2023:** *Multiple A/B Testing with Always-Valid e-values.* Joint work with Lihua Lei; presented algorithms to compute the graphical approach for FWER control with (always-valid) e-values using a weighted local test. Pre-print to come soon.
* **Experimentation and Causal Inference, Stanford, June 2023:** *Multiple A/B Testing with Always-Valid e-values.*
* **Stanford Statistics Retreat, May 2023:** *Once Upon a Stream: Mining for Significance.* Presented on a real-world example of multiple testing and selective inference analysis done in the context of testing for cheating in a 2020 Minecraft speedrun.

# Teaching

**Primary Instructor:**

* **Stats 100: Mathematics of Sport** *(Spring 2023, Winter 2024)* Taught sports statistics class, with topics ranging from linear models to Markov chains. Students completed final projects which are displayed on [this website](https://stats100blog.wordpress.com/).

* **Stats 217: Stochastic Processes I** *(Summer 2023)* Taught stochastic prcesses class, using Dobrow's textbook, covering discrete and continuous Markov chains, branching processes, and Poisson processes.
